## Letâ€™s look at headers!

Is anyone else experiencing issues with objects not deleting when hitting the delete key on your keyboard? Also the same problem with moving objects with the arrows on your keyboard? It's only happened in the last month or so and I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this? I contacted sketch but have heard nothing back...

I'm trying to hand off an element with a box-shadow like (0 12px 12px -8px), but have thus far been unsuccessful in finding a way to do this in Sketch. Any ideas?
